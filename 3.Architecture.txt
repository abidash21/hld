Architecture: Internal design details for building the applications.

1. Monolithic Architecure: 
   All the application components and functionalities are built and deployed
   as a single uint.
   - single codebase
   - Tightly Coupled components
   - Shared Resources
   - Centralised System


Distributed Systems: Collection of multiple individual systems(including replicas)
                     connected through a network that share resources, communicate 
                     and coordinate to achieve common goals.

2. Microservices Architecture:
   Apporach to building application where each business capability is its own
   service
   - Independently deployed
   - Loosely Coupled
   - Modularisation

# Microservices are a type of distributed system
