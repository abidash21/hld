latency: delay between a user's action and the system's response

Monolithic-  computational delay 
Microservice- computational delay + network delay

how to reduce?
1. Caching: Process of storing information for a set period of time on a computer
2. CDN(content delivery network): Geographically distributed networks of proxy servers and
                                  their objective is to serve content to users more quickly.
3. Upgrade system hardwares

Throughput: The volume of information transmitted through a system per unit time

Throughput is more in Microservice architecture than Monolithic architecture because
1. No limit on resources
2. Load Balancer

causes of low Throughput:
1. latency
2. Protocol overhead
3. congestion
