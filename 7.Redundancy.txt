Redundancy: Duplication of nodes

Types:
1. Active Redundancy - Each unit is active and responding. Mulitple nodes connected to load balancer.
                       Each unit receives equal load.

2. Passive Redundancy - some nodes active other are not. During break down of active nodes, the passive nodes
                        maintain availability by becoming active node


Replication: Redundancy + synchronization

Types:
1. Active Replication: All nodes read and write
2. Passive Replication: Primary node for write and other for read.

*synchronous: If the changes are made to the master and slave at the same time
*asynchronous: If changes are queued up and written later



Load balancer: Process of efficient distribution of network traffic across all nodes of microservice architecture

- Equall distribution over all nodes
- health check(if node is not operational then,request is passed to another node that is up and running)

challanges:
1. Single Point of Failure(soln. add passive load balancer)

Algorithms:
1. Round Robin
2. weighted round robin(for nodes with better resources)
3. IP hash algo(random unbiased distribution)
4. source IP hash(combines source and destination IP address for hash key)
5. Least conncetion Algorithms
6. Least Response Time
